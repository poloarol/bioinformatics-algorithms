# Bioinformatics Algorithms

Solutions to Rosalind bioinformatics problems using Python: https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/

What is present:

1. Description of the problem and link to Rosalind
2. Input and Output file
3. Solution in Python
4. Testing using PyTest module.

## Usage:

1. python -m venv your-environment-name
2. source activate your-environment-name
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. deactivate (Use when done!)

## Future Steps
1. Ameliorate some of the algorithms as I move forward, because some solutions are slow
